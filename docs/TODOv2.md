# HackX Simplified: Core Hackathon Platform TODOv2

## üéØ Core Philosophy

- **Hackathon-first approach**: Focus only on essential hackathon functions
- **IPFS-heavy**: Store all metadata on IPFS, minimal on-chain validation data
- **Simple contracts**: Basic validation and state management only
- **No complex fund distribution**: Simple winner designation without automated payouts

## üìä Simplified Progress Overview

- **Total Points**: 65 (vs 170 in v1)
- **Core Functions**: Hackathon creation, project submission, judge scoring
- **Focus**: MVP for hackathon functionality without complex financial features

**On-chain Data**:

```solidity
struct Hackathon {
    uint256 id;
    address organizer;
    string ipfsHash;  // All hackathon details stored here
    address hackathonContract;
    uint256 createdAt;

}
```

## Epic 2: Simplified Judge System (15 points)

### Story 2.1: SimpleJudgeRegistry.sol (8 points)

**Description**: Basic judge assignment and scoring
**Tasks**:

- [ ] Judge invitation by hackathon organizer
- [ ] Judge acceptance (simple boolean)
- [ ] Score submission (1-100 score per project per category)
- [ ] Basic winner calculation (highest score wins)
- [ ] No complex criteria or weighted scoring

**On-chain Data**:

```solidity
struct Judge {
    address wallet;
    bool isAccepted;
    mapping(uint256 => mapping(uint256 => uint256)) scores; // hackathonId => projectId => score
    mapping(uint256 => bool) hasEvaluated; // hackathonId => evaluated
}

struct JudgingResult {
    uint256 projectId;
    uint256 totalScore;
    uint256 judgeCount;
}
```

### Story 2.2: Basic Scoring System (7 points)

**Description**: Simple scoring without complex calculations
**Tasks**:

- [ ] Submit score (1-100) for each project
- [ ] Calculate average score across judges
- [ ] Determine winner per category (highest average)
- [ ] Store winner designation on-chain
- [ ] No reputation system or complex consensus

**IPFS Judge Feedback**:
